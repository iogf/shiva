Shiva is a platform whose goal is allowing flexible means to help people.
It is based on the concept of Tickets, when someone has available resource for donnation
it creates a ticket. The same occurs when one is in need of some resource. 

People who created tickets to search for help it would get notified of resources being
available through E-mail. The notification occurs based on resource type, country, city 
mostly.

I came accross the goal of this project when i met Cara Arellano (cara.arellano@berkeley.edu). 
She invited me to participate in a project to help India to recover from COVID-19 issues. 

I was told the project was the creation of a platform to simplify the process of finding 
available resources for donnation. I liked the project goal and i decided to develop Shiva
with less strict constraints to permit it working in a wider scenary.
