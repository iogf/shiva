Shiva is a platform whose goal is allowing flexible means to help people.
It is based on the concept of Tickets, when one needs help it creates a ticket,
when one wanna help it creates a ticket.

A ticket maps to some avaiable or missing resource, it can be utilities, clothes, food
or even a folks who are offering shelter.

When a ticket mapping to an available resource is created then it performs a search for tickets
from people who are in need of help for that kind of resource then an E-mmail is sent
to those people to inform them of new available resources.

The ticket matching criteria takes also into accout country and city.

I came accross the goal of this project when i met Cara Arellano (cara.arellano@berkeley.edu). 
She invited me to participate in a project to help India to recover from COVID-19 issues. 

I was told the project was the creation of a platform to simplify the process of finding 
available resources for donnation. I liked the project goal and i decided to work on Shiva.
